typeplate-wp
============
A Typographic Starter Kit packaged in a tiny WordPress plugin. We don’t make aesthetic design choices, but define proper markup with extensible styling for common typographic patterns. A stripped-down CSS library concerned with the appropriate technical implementation of design patterns—not how they look.

Simply put, typeplate-wp injects Typeplate into the &lt;head&gt; of your WordPress theme.
